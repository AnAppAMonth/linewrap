    In text display, line wrap is the feature of continuing on
a new line when a line is full, such that each line fits in the viewable window, allowing text to be read
from top to bottom without any horizontal scrolling. Word wrap is the additional feature of most text editors, word
processors, and web browsers, of breaking lines between
and not within words, except when a single word is longer than a line.
    A soft return or soft wrap is the break resulting
from line wrap or word wrap (whether automatic or manual), whereas a hard return or
hard wrap is an intentional break, creating a new paragraph.
With a hard enter, paragraph-break
formatting may be applied (either indenting or
vertical whitespace). Soft wrapping allows line lengths to adjust automatically with adjustments
to the width of the user's
window or margin settings, and is a standard
feature of all modern text editors, word processors, and email clients. Manual soft breaks are unnecessary
when word wrap is automatically, so hitting the "Enter" key usually produces a hard return.
    Alternatively, "soft enter" can mean an intentional, stored line break that is not a paragraph break. For example, it is common to print postal addresses in a multiple-line format, but the several lines are understood to be a single paragraph. Line breaks are needed to divide the words of the address into lines of the appropriate length.
    In the contemporary graphical word processors
Microsoft Word and OpenOffice.org, users are expected to type a carriage return (enter key) between each
paragraph. Formatting settings,
such as first-line indentation or spacing between paragraphs,
take effect where the carriage return marks the break. A non-paragraph line break, which is a soft
return, is inserted using shift-enter or via the menus, and is provided for cases when the text should start on
a new line but none of the other side effects
of starting a new paragraph are desired.
    In text-oriented markup languages, a soft return is
typically offered as a markup tag. For example, in HTML there is a <br> tag that has the same purpose
as the soft return in word processors described above; the <p> tag is used to contain paragraphs.
    The Unicode character set provides a line separator
character as well as a paragraph separator to represent the semantics of the soft return and hard return.

    The soft returns are usually placed after the ends
of complete words, or after the punctuation that follows complete words. However, word wrap may also
occur following a hyphen inside of a word. This is sometimes not
desired, and can be blocked by using a non-breaking hyphen, or hard hyphen, instead of a regular hyphen.
    A word without hyphens can be made wrappable by having
soft hyphens in it. When the word isn't wrapped (i.e., isn't broken across lines), the soft hyphen isn't visible.
But if the word is wrapped across lines, this is done at the
soft hyphen, at which point it is shown as a visible hyphen on the top line where the word is broken. (In the rare case of a word that is meant to be wrappable by breaking it across lines but without making a hyphen ever appear, a zero-width space is put at the permitted breaking point(s) in the word.)
    Sometimes word wrap is undesirable between adjacent
words. In such cases, word wrap can usually be blocked by using a hard space or non-breaking space between the words, instead
of regular spaces.
    In Chinese, Japanese, and Korean, each Han
character is normally considered a word,[citation needed] and therefore word wrapping can usually occur before
and after any Han character.
    Under certain circumstances, however, word
wrapping is not desired. For instance,
        word wrapping might not be desired within personal names, and
        word wrapping might not be desired
within any compound words (when the text is flush
left but only in some styles).
    Most existing word processors and
typesetting software cannot handle either of the above scenarios.
    CJK punctuation may or may not follow rules similar to the above-mentioned special
circumstances. It is up to line breaking rules in CJK.
    A special case of line breaking rules in CJK, however, always applies: line wrap must never occur inside the CJK dash
and ellipsis. Even though each of these punctuation marks must be represented by
two characters due to a limitation of all
existing character encodings, each of these are intrinsically a single punctuation mark that is two ems wide, not
two one-em-wide punctuation marks.
    Word wrapping is an optimization problem. Depending on what needs to be optimized
for, different algorithms are used.
    A simple way to do word wrapping is to use a greedy algorithm that puts as many
words on a line as possible, then moving on to the next line to do the same until
there are no more words left to place. This method
is used by many modern word processors, such as OpenOffice.org Writer and Microsoft Word. This algorithm
always uses the minimum possible number of lines but may lead to lines of widely varying lengths. The following pseudocode
implements this algorithm:
